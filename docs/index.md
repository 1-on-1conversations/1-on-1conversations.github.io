# What is 1-on-1 Conversations?
1-on-1 Conversations is a meetup format where participants talk to one another (1:1) and rotate every few minutes.

# What makes this format special?
This format promotes equality as it ensures that everyone in the meetup is engaged and actively participating. No one is left out.
Everyone's voice is heard. Additionally, this format works great in language learning meetups.
