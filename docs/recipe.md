# How does the 1-on-1 conversation format work?
The suggested group size is 12 participants. The suggested conversation length is 10 minutes.

Letâ€™s assume that all 12 participants show up on time and there are 6 tables available at our venue (i.e. coffee shop, classroom, park, etc):

All participants are paired up, and each pair goes to a table.
The event host starts the timer and announces the beginning of the first round.
8 minutes into the first round, the event host gives a two-minute warning to all participants so they can wrap up their conversations.
When the time is up, the event host leads a group rotation where every participant but the event host will rotate to the left.
This cycle is repeated as many times as necessary.

If the recipe is followed without disruption, everyone should get a chance to speak to everyone in approximately 2 hours.
At the discretion of the event host, the conversation time can vary depending on the group size.

If the number of participants that show up is an odd number (i.e. 7, 9 or 11), the event host may ask a participant to always sit with him.
